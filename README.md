# CodeupCapstone
Final Assignment for Codeup
In this reppo I keep the code that my partner Tino Gutierrez and I would use to manage and modify the resources we would need for our capstone. We felt that deploying our infrastructure as code (IaC) allowed us to work more effeciently while also giving us a chance to apply more of what we learned. I ppersonally loved "Linux Week" where we learned about BASH scripting and working with the terminal. (Tino inserts his entry here)
